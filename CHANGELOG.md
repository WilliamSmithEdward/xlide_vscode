# Changelog

All notable changes to **XLIDE: VBA for VS Code** are documented here.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- Unified the XLIDE Explorer welcome message: a single entry shown in all sessions (host and Live Share guest) with the workbook hint, Refresh link, and brief Live Share notes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Module tree accordion** — clicking a module tab or tree node auto-expands that module's procedure list and collapses all others. Closes last tab to collapse everything.
- **Accordion debounce** — rapid Ctrl+W cycling coalesces into a single tree update (60 ms), eliminating race-condition stragglers.
- **Add Class Module** command and context menu item with `Class_Initialize` / `Class_Terminate` stub.
- **Module type detection overhaul** — UserForms identified by two-GUID `VB_Base` pattern (works for both live workbook and exported `.cls` files). Document CLSIDs for Workbook / Worksheet / Chart correctly classified.
- **COM window focus** — after opening a workbook or running a macro on Windows, Excel is restored and brought to the foreground via P/Invoke (`ShowWindow` + `SetForegroundWindow`).
- **Symbol kinds** — Outline / breadcrumbs now show Const → Constant, Enum → Enum, Type → Struct icons in addition to Sub / Function / Property.
- **listModules cache** — module list cached per workbook during a session; cleared on tree refresh to avoid stale data.
- **Filesystem watcher debounce** — rapid save-storm events coalesce into a single explorer refresh (200 ms).
- **Cancellation tokens** — `bridge.call()` accepts an optional `CancellationToken`; pending RPC requests are rejected on cancellation.
- **Smoke test command** (`XLIDE: Run Smoke Test`) — verifies listModules and readModule against a workspace workbook from the command palette.
- **TS unit tests** — vitest suite covering `parseVbaModule` (Sub/Function/Property/Const/Enum/Type, line spans, visibility) and `decodeModuleUri` (module name decode, URL encoding, extension variants, error cases).
- **Python unit tests** — pytest suite covering `_split_vba_source` (round-trip, VERSION/BEGIN/END stripping) and `_module_type` (userform two-GUID, document CLSIDs, name heuristics, PredeclaredId).
- **CI workflow** — GitHub Actions runs `npm run compile` + `npm test` (TypeScript) and `pytest` (Python) on push and pull requests.
- **Export path fix** — class modules now export as `.cls`; document modules as `.cls`; userforms as `.frm`; standard modules as `.bas`.
- **Import UX** — `.frm` / document / userform files that don't exist in the live workbook are shown with an explanatory detail in the QuickPick and cannot be selected.
- **Live Share** — module type surfaced for remote modules; userform icon and sort order applied consistently.
- **Status bar** — shows active workbook / module name; Live Share guest count.
- **VBA snippets** — 21 snippet entries (`sub`, `func`, `for`, `forEach`, `with`, `select`, `class`, `prop`, …).
- **onEnterRules** — auto-insert `End Sub` / `End Function` / `End If` / `Next` / `Loop` / `Wend` on Enter, matching VBE behaviour.
- **Bridge auto-restart** — unexpected Python child-process exit marks the bridge stopped; next call shows a clear actionable error.
- **Workbook-locked UX** — WinError 32 / sharing violation detected and surfaced as a warning with a Retry action.
- **Marketplace display name** updated to `XLIDE: VBA for VS Code`.

### Changed
- Context menu reorganised into logical groups: create, edit, workbook, transfer, settings.
- `xlide.newClassModule` replaces the generic new-module path for class modules.
